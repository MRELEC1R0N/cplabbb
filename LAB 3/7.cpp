// Create a class named Shirt that has the public data members collarsize and sleeveLength.
// Create a class named Pants that has the public data members waistSize and inSeam. Write a
// program that declares one object of each type Shirt and Pants and assigns values to the objectsâ€™
// data fields. Write two overloaded functions named displayClothingFacts(). One version of the
// function takes a Shirt object as an argument; the other version takes a Pants object. Each
// version displays the facts about the piece of clothing. Your main() function should demonstrate
// that you can call displayClothingFacts() with either type of clothing.
